# Vue Basic Calculator

A Basic Calculator using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Brunch.js](http://brunch.io/)

## Note:

A simple calculator built using vuejs and brunchjs. I wanted an excuse to dive into brunch a little bit and had this concept for a calculator one day as I was driving into work. So "why not" I said. Let me know of any other curious ways to create calculators. This was my first attempt and was very entertaining.

Features:

* Collects inputs and determines intened number
* Calculates out come based on operator used/ selected
* KEYBOARD Support!

```

## Issues

Feel free to create an issue or pull request for any bugs you may find or to just let me know of any other curious ways to create calculators.

## TODO:

1. Create a History of calculations
2. Add tests for key methods
3. Make code less jumbled
